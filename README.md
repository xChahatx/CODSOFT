#  SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project is all about building a real-time SMS classifier that predicts whether a message is **spam or ham (not spam)** using machine learning. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and models like **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes** to get the job done â€” fast and smart.



##  What It Does
- Preprocesses real-world SMS message data
- Converts text into vectors using **TF-IDF**
- Trains models to classify messages accurately
- Evaluates performance with **confusion matrix**, **F1-score**, and **accuracy**
- Adds a sleek **Gradio web interface** to test messages live
- Visualizes the class balance and message lengths using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

##  Tech Stack
- Python 
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib & seaborn
- gradio (for interactive interface)

---

##  Visualizations
- Spam vs Ham message count
- Message length distribution by category
