#  SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project is all about building a real-time SMS classifier that predicts whether a message is **spam or ham (not spam)** using machine learning. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and models like **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes** to get the job done — fast and smart.



##  What It Does
- Preprocesses real-world SMS message data
- Converts text into vectors using **TF-IDF**
- Trains models to classify messages accurately
- Evaluates performance with **confusion matrix**, **F1-score**, and **accuracy**
- Adds a sleek **Gradio web interface** to test messages live
- Visualizes the class balance and message lengths using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

##  Tech Stack
- Python 
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib & seaborn
- gradio (for interactive interface)

---

##  Visualizations
- Spam vs Ham message count
- Message length distribution by category

Here are the GitHub README templates for your **Churn Prediction** and **Fraud Credit Prediction** projects based on the format in your SMS Spam Detection README:

###  **Churn Prediction with Machine Learning**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn — whether a customer will leave a service or stay — using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify at-risk customers in order to take proactive retention measures.

 **Key Features:**

* Uses **Random Forest Classifier** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for predictive modeling.
* Based on features like tenure, service usage, and customer demographics.
* Helps improve business decisions by anticipating churn.

 **Tech Stack:**

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

 **Workflow:**

1. Data preprocessing and feature encoding
2. Train-test split
3. Model training with Random Forest and SVM
4. Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

 **Outcome:**
Provides a model capable of predicting churn probability with high accuracy and performance.

###  **Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning**

This project is aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. It’s based on a real-world dataset with imbalanced classes.

 **Key Features:**

* Real-time fraud detection system using transaction-level features.
* Handles **imbalanced datasets** using methods like SMOTE or undersampling.
* Uses algorithms such as **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**.

 **Tech Stack:**

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

 **Workflow:**

1. Data cleaning and exploration
2. Balancing class distribution
3. Training models on transaction features
4. Model evaluation with ROC-AUC, precision-recall curves

 **Goal:**
Minimize false negatives to ensure high security while maintaining low false positives to avoid disruption to genuine users.
